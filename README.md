Description: CudaMemAllocator is an advanced memory management system designed to optimize GPU memory allocation for high-performance applications using CUDA. This project focuses on developing a custom memory allocator that enhances the efficiency of memory usage on GPUs by reducing fragmentation, improving allocation speed, and offering better control over memory blocks. It provides a flexible and scalable memory pool, ensuring that CUDA-based applications can execute resource-intensive tasks without hitting memory bottlenecks.

Key Features:

Custom memory allocation strategy tailored for CUDA environments.
Memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead.
Fragmentation mitigation techniques for long-running applications.
Fine-grained control over memory usage, including memory block size and alignment.
Support for both device and host memory management.
Performance benchmarking to evaluate allocation efficiency and speed.
CudaMemAllocator is ideal for developers working on GPU-accelerated applications in fields such as machine learning, high-performance computing, and game development, where optimal memory usage is critical for performanc
